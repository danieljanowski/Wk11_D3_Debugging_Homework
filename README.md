Answer the following questions:
1. What is the purpose of a breakpoint?
To stop execution of the program at desired point.

2. Does the line of code on a breakpoint run when you start debugging?
No. Debugger waits for the user to execute it.

3. How do we debug the next line of code?
By choosing step in or step over option.

4. What does the step into command do?
It steps into the method called in the line of code.

5. What is the difference between evaluate expression and evaluate code fragment?
Expresion alows user to execute single line of code while code fragment allows to execute longer multiple lines of code (i.e. add temporary variables)
